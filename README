Mercury
... because Sinatra is not the only one performing on the stage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mercury aims to be a Sinatra-like web framework (or DSL, if you like) for 
creating web applications in Lua, quickly and painlessly.

Mercury is currently in its very early stages of development, it started like 
an hack and right now it still is nothing more than that. Having said that, I 
thought that things might get interesting and so I decided to release the 
actual source code and start working on it to get it properly done.

This README will be updated later with notes and instructions on how to get it 
working (and even with an explanation for the name of this project :-)).
